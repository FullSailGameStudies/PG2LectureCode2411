			add a new class, Pistol, that derives from Weapon.
			Pistol should have fields with getters/setters for rounds and magCapacity.
			Add a constructor that calls the base constructor

		COMPILE-TIME Polymorphism

		Method Overloading:
			- changing the number of parameters
			- changing the types of the parameters



		CHALLENGE:
			Add an OVERLOAD of the calcDamage method in the Weapon class.
			The overload should take an int parameter called modifier
			to increase the damage when calculating the damage.

	/*

		COMPILE-TIME Polymorphism

		Operator Overloading
		overload the + in the Pistol class to add 2 pistols
			- it sets the magCapacity to the max of the 2 pistols
			- adds the # of rounds from both pistols. should not exceed the magCapacity.

		RUNTIME Polymorphism

		║ OVERRIDING  ║ - changing the behavior of a base method
		╚═════════════╝

		1) add 'virtual' to the base method
		2) add a method to the derived class that has the same signature as the base.
			OPTIONALLY put 'override' on the derived method


		FULLY OVERRIDING:
			not calling the base method from the derived method

		EXTENDING:
			calling the base method from the derived method
			to call the base method...  baseClassName::method(...)



		CHALLENGE:
			Override Weapon's showMe method in the Pistol class.
			In Pistol's version, call the base version then print out the rounds and magCapacity
